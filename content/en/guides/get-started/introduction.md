## Introduction
There are two things that we need to consider when setting up business. 
- User Journey (Customer-lifecycle framework) specific to business
- Components to support User journey. e.g. SEO, Facebook, Wordpress, Magento, Stripe, Paypal, Logistics, etc.

Understanding your user's journey (buying pattern) and support that user journey with components.

Isn't it simple, just two things needs to be taken care of. Yet selling is hard and online selling is very competitive in nature. Why?

Every business have their unique user journey. And, components required to support those journey might be different. New components are coming to market everyday and early adopters get benefit of new platforms. However, businesses cannot afford to try out new components as there is cost involve into that. 

You need to focus on your users' journey and how to make that journey better. Prioritize what adds most value to users' journey and do that rather than what is cool.
